# Eclipse Issue Tracker
This is the official issue tracker for [Eclipse](https://eclipseemu.me), a Web-based multi-system emulator. There is no source code on this repository.

## How to Submit Feedback
To create a new issue (despite the name, it also applies to feature requests and enhancements), click [here](https://github.com/iGBAEmu/EclipseIssues/issues/new). Your title should be relevant to your issue/request. In your description, provide any screenshots, errors, and descriptions relevant to the issue. You should also include steps to recreate bugs (if applicable), as well as your browser, operating system, and system version.

### What Not to Do

The following should never be done:

- **Being Vague** Please be descriptive in what the issue entails. If it's a bug, describe the bug as stated above. If it's a feature, describe it and provide any concept art (if applicable).

- **Duplicates** If your issue is already open, don't make another issue. Instead, describe that you are experiencing the same issue in a reply to another entry. To view current issues, [click here](https://github.com/iGBAEmu/EclipseIssues/issues).

- **Close Prematurely** If you are closing an issue, you are agreeing that it is no longer needed (example: a bug fix was implemented). If you are closing it, please say why.

- **Report Vulnerabilities with GitHub** If you have a possible security flaw, contact a member of the Eclipse team directly, such as @HeyItsShuga or @1GamerDev on Twitter. We don't want anyone abusing a vulnerability before it's fixed!
